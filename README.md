Developed a personal **Portfolio** to showcase my skills to recuirters as I am actively looking for **Software Development/ Software Engineering Interships** at better organization.

Portfolio includes 1 page with 6 sections as follows:

**1. Home** </br>
**2. About** </br>
**3. Skills** </br>
**4. Curriculum (Education, Work Experience)** </br>
**5. Projects** </br>
**6. Contact** </br>

I have used HTML, CSS, and little bit of JavaScript. I've incorporated a number of controls and features, some of which are listed below:

- Favicon: created an icon of my own.
- Form: to send message in the Contact section (email to my inbox).
- Images: built a gallery in Project section, with hover effect viewing the project name and redirecting to project link upon click. Also, included profile pic and some quote images.
- Button: Used to download resume and cover letter.
- Implented external CSS file for styling.
- Followed column layout structure for effective oriantation.
- Used absolute/relative position whenever necessary.
- Smooth scroll down to respective section upon link click like About, Skills, etc.
- Transition animation upon hover on buttons.
- Page is responsive for tablet and mobile screen as well (<980px, <700px)
- Added the menu icon that gets visible when screen size <980px, to select the sections.
- Used mailto and tel options in the Contact section.
